            <p>Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.
                Conan Doyle once wrote, "Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until
                Poe breathed the breath of life into it?" Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow that of Lecoq.</p>

<h2>Fictional character biography</h2><hr>
<h3>Family and early life</h3>
<p>Details of Sherlock Holmes's life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.</p>

<h3>Life with Watson</h3>
<p>Financial difficulties lead Holmes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</a> to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London.Their residence is
    maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson.[26] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years.</p><hr>
